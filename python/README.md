# Objective

Fill in the NumberFormat/numberformat.md file such that all the tests that run on `make test` pass.

# Building the project

Assuming python >3 all you should need to do is

    $ make
    $ make test
You can then edit `NumberFormat/numberformat.py` and modify the stringify_number routine until all tests pass
